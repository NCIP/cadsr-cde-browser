## This file assigns a resource (Business Object) to a
## deployment key for the Handler.  This is loaded by the
## DeploymentManager class.
##
## For example, a Handler implementation's 
## getConnection(sessionId) method uses this file to find 
## out which deployment key to load for its reference class.
##
## The 'default' property ensures that any resources that 
## are not explicitly listed are assigned a deployment key
